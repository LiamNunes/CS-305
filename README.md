    • The client, Artemis Financial, is a financial advising institution. They are looking to create a secure website to assist with business endeavors. They must have a high degree of security for the website and servers due to the nature of the information that they keep and the regulations that they face as a financial service provider.
    •  It is important to code securely because if you don’t then your client could end up getting hacked. Hackers will use any vulnerability you leave them to get it and it is your duty to your client to give them the best product you can, this include making sure they and all of their clients are safe.
    • Trying to think of coding through the lens of security was the most challenging part of the vulnerability assignment. Trying to think of how everything can be exploited was a strange mindset for me. But it will be a valuable tool for me going forward as now when I am programming it will always be in the back of my mind that I need to make sure to not leave any vulnerabilities. 
    • I tired to increase layers of security by recommending various security measures and implementing good encryption. 
    • I tried to make sure that my code was as secure and functional as possible by trying to keep it simple and limit the amount of outside input could be had on it. 
    • The dependency check tool is an extremely useful tool that I intend to use on my maven projects in the future to ensure that none of the dependencies I am using have any glaring weaknesses and vulnerabilities
    • I will show future employers the financial vulnerability assessment report to show them that I can critically think about security and that I know about the various aspects that will effect our clients.
